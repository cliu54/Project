# Project
1. Extend the starter GUI app that allows users to enter observations of Whales, and shows a chart of observations.
	5. Take the starter JavaFX code and use MVC and Observer concepts to handle state changes. The final code should demonstrate how the number of whales of a given species entered is reflected in the whale chart. 
2. Add at least two FXTest tests to show UI testing. Use the sample code in the `/test` directory.
3. Update the code where needed, to conform to general OO principles as we have been discussing, including preserving encapsulation and preventing duplication.

## Deliverables
* unit tests of the JavaFX code, showing how the model changes are managed, and one GUI test using TestFX.
* A sequence diagram that shows the Observer/MVC pattern from a user entering a value, until the chart is updated.
* The source code of the finished MVC pattern.
