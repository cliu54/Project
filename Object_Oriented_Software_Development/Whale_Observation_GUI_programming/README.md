# Project
1. Extend the starter GUI app that allows users to enter observations of Whales, and shows a chart of observations.
	Use MVC and Observer concepts to handle state changes. The final code demonstrates how the number of whales of a given species entered is reflected in the whale chart. 
2. Add two FXTest tests to show UI testing. Use the sample code in the `/test` directory.
3. Update the code where needed, to conform having the general OO principles including preserving encapsulation and preventing duplication.

## Deliverables
* unit tests of the JavaFX code, showing how the model changes are managed, and one GUI test using TestFX.
* The source code of the finished MVC pattern.
