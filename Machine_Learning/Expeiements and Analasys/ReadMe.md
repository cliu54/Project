# Objectives
1. The first part involves in implementing three methods: Decision Tree, Random Forest 
and Neural Network. The dataset has being used is clean_processed.cleveland.data. The data has already been modified 
to binary input for either one or zero.

2. The second part is to introduce in a selected problem analyze the result by applying the built-in models from the 
first part. I wrote an analytic document in report.pdf. The dataset has been chosen is dataset4.txt

# 
1. This Code is my individual work. I used one function dtree_grid_search() from Lab1. Also I used some of the codes from Lab2 for visualization.

2. I used google.colab library upload method to manually click on the selected file. In order to make this program run you need to manually upload files, cleaned_processed.cleveland.data and dataset4 files one by one. These text files are in code.zip which also contains my code.

Thank you :)
