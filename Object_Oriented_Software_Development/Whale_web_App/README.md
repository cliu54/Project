## Video demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eneeZsE-UdY
1. Illustrate how to compile and run in sbt
2. play around whale/observation add and search function in the whale web application

Note,There is an issue with build.sbt after I uploaded the project to Github. I will resolve this issue as soon as 
possible. The codebase in Github is the same as I ran from my local machine. 

## Project 
- Using Play framework, and learning about web development frameworks and architecture.
- Implementing a web app using java: routing, controllers, models, views. 
- Applying OO design concepts like encapsulation into a web app framework.
- Working with complex frameworks in teams; work assignment and schedule management.
- Front-end development.
- A bit (tiny bit) about sbt, the Scala Build Tool.

## Deliverables
* The source code of the complete web application.
* Tests, showing functionality.
 
## Program ran by Gradle
- After compile and run from sbt shell. Type in http://localhost:9000 to the web browser.
- The app runs locally only.


- Improved project efficiency by using programming language mechanisms (exception handling, serialization, concurrency and synchronization,reflection, MVC etc.)
- Applied general design principles, design patterns and design smells to my project. 
- Used software automatic testing tool(JUnit) for running Unit tests. Ran an integration test to test my project as a group. Ran FXTest tests for UI testing. Tested every operation on the models from a web app.
- Loaded JSON object from the Web page and parsed it locally (By Jackson), Rest API
- Used Guice to inject stub class and real code dynamically
- Used Play Framework and implemented a web app using Java: routing, controller,
model, and views. a bit about the Scala Build Tool.
