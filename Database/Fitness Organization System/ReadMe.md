This Database Project is to implement real-life fitness center database. 

Written in PostgreSQL 10.

Here is the brief description of the system:

The organization consists of members for which we must track a name, fitness-center ID,
mailing address, contact details, membership status (i.e., full, guest, drop-in, and others), and
membership type. Each membership type has a full name and indicates the kinds of services
of the centre for which members are eligible to access. There is a system of passes, ranging
in duration to single drop-ins, to a set of 10 drop-ins, to a quarterly pass, to an annual pass;
passes are also specific to that kind of service to be used by the member. Passes must, of
course, be purchased, and these transactions must be recorded.

BAA also offers additional services that are specially scheduled, such as camps which offer
specific kinds of training of several weeks for training in certain kinds of events in the
community (e.g., training for 10K competitions). These camps have instructors (who may or
may not also be members) along with lists of enrolled members. Enrolment in camps is in
addition to membership passes.

Lastly there is some merchandise that is sold at the front desk, such as T-shirts, towels,
locks for change-room lockers, etc. Such merchandise sales are not necessarily restricted to
members.

To understand the logic of the code :
1. Diagram.pdf demonstrates the relationship of each table
2. set of schema.pdf represents the key and the parameters of each table.
3. For myQuery.sql. I created 10 questions and got the output from manipulating the sql queries.
